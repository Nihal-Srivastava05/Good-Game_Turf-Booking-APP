# Good-Game_Turf-Booking-System

This is a sports turf booking app (Like an event booking app) with added feature of connecting with people to play with. It has in-buit chatting system in which we can make rooms so people can communicate and find new people. It also has a credit system which you can earn by playing and winning more games and those points can be later redemeed into gift coupons or items from store.

This web app is made in **React js** with **graphql** backend which links with **mongodb** database. It also uses a socket.io server for messaging feature.

## Setup:
- Install the necessary packages by using the `npm install`
- The above command needs to be done at three places(react, graphql and socket server) 
- First do `npm install` at root directory then cd into frontend and do the same and last do it in server folder.
- To run the server run `npm start` on root directory.
- To client client app cd into frontend and run `npm start`
- finally for messaging cd into server and run `npm start`
- Go to https://localhost:3000/ to view the app.
